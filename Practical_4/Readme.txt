I am adding my 4th Practical to this folder as well which is the Radian Rule program written in C.
My code ran correctly on sciprog, after which i am uploading here in Github as well.
For compilation i used the following "gcc -o Rad Radian.c -lm" and then used "./Rad" for execution(running the program).
