I am trying to add a new folder into my github branch.I hope this works.
I was adding all the codes directly to sciprog for the meantime. Because i didnt understand how to make an empty folder since Github does not recognizes an empty folder.
I hope i am doing it correctly this time. I will be creating and adding all the programs again in their respective folders.
I will be adding my 3rd Practical to this folder as well which is the Trapezoidal Rule program written in C.
My code ran correctly on sciprog, after which i am uploading here in Github as well.
For compilation i used the following "gcc -o Trap Trapezoidal.c -lm" and then used "./Trap" for execution(running the program).
